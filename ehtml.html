                            Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing farming in India, where half of the workforce relies on agriculture. Cutting-edge innovations like AI-driven sensors, mobile apps, and robots are significantly enhancing productivity and resource efficiency. These technologies provide real-time data on weather and soil health, leading to better water conservation and more precise irrigation, while AI-powered robots optimize pesticide use, reducing waste and improving sustainability.
Despite these advancements, only 2% of Indian farmers currently utilize such technologies. This highlights a critical need for improved digital infrastructure and stronger public-private partnerships to ensure that the benefits of AI in agriculture reach a broader segment of the farming population. Expanding access to these innovations is vital for meeting the growing food demands of the nation.
